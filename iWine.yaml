    # Introduction
    Thank you for choosing the iWine smart decanter. 
    The iWine decanter can automatically warm up or cool down the wine, aerate it, measure wine temperature, sugar and alcohol contents, and even determine the type of wine using the patented machine-learning algorithms.
    
    To control the decanter you can use the iWine Mobile App available on [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/en/app/iWine) or [Google Play](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iwine.app).     
    Alternatively, you can use the HTTP API to integrate the decanter with any third-party system, platform or device.

    This manual describes the iWine smart decanter HTTP API.
    
    
    # Connecting the device to your Wi-Fi
    When the decanter is turned on for the first time, it creates its own Wi-Fi network with the name "iWine".
        
    1. Connect to the "iWine" network and navigate to [https://192.168.1.1/](https://192.168.1.1/)
    2. When prompted, specify the credentials to access the built-in web server.     
    >The default credentials for the decanter are: "iWine" as login and "inVinoVeritas" as password.
    
    3. On the home page, select **"Wi-Fi Settings"** tab.
    4. Specify the name (SSID) of your Wi-Fi network in the **"Network Name"** field and its passphrase in the **"WPA passphrase"** field.
    5. Press **"Join Network"**.

    The device will reboot and then connect to your Wi-Fi network. 
    
    Check your router, to learn what IP address was assigned to the iWine decanter. In the further sections of the manual, the IP address assigned to the iWine decanter will be denoted as **_Device_IP_**.

    To restore factory settings (including the default credentials) and reset network configuration, press the "Reset" button on the device for 3 seconds.

    # How to use iWine HTTP API
    The iWine smart decanter provides a built-in web server. The iWine Mobile application and third-party systems use the server's HTTP API to retrieve information about wine and perform certain operations on it.
    
    For example, accessing the [https://Device_IP/api/v1/temperature](https://Device_IP/api/v1/temperature) URL would return the current temperature of a wine. 
    Whereas, accessing the following URL [https://Device_IP/api/v1/aerate?stir-time=180](https://Device_IP/api/v1/aerate?stir-time=180) would stir the wine for 180 seconds to aerate it.
    
    Most of operations could take some time to perform. For instance, the aeration from the call above will perform for 180 seconds. 
    Such asynchronous operations are implemented using callbacks. When we invoke the operation, the server sends immediate response that the operation has started, and later receives a callback notifying whether the operation has completed successfully or has failed.

    The "Wine operations" section describes what information could be retrieved and what actions the decanter can perform.
    
    ## Authentication
    Before reading any data or calling any operations you should first authenticate to the built-in web server. The iWine smart decanter offers two forms of authentication: Basic access and API key. They can be used separately or be combined.

    ### Basic access authentication
    When accessing the built-in web server for the first time, you will be prompted for login and password. Further requests to server would contain your credentials in HTTP header fields. 
    >The default credentials for the decanter are: "iWine" as login and "inVinoVeritas" as password.
    
    To specify a new password, use the `/setpass` operation.
    
    ### API Key authentication
    Alternatively to specifying login and password you can specify special API key as URL query parameter. For example, [https://Device_IP/api/v1/temperature?api_key=inVinoVeritas1234567890](https://Device_IP/api/v1/temperature?api_key=inVinoVeritas1234567890).
    >The default API key for the decanter is: "inVinoVeritas1234567890".
    
    To generate a new API key, use the `/setkey` operation.
